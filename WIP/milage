(plan to stay entirely in webapp while on stitch)

will need some variables, collect data, then calc


Retroactive  or whenever charge is completed?
a new collection might be beneficial

1. last paid exists and get amount paid2 and odo2
2. second last paid get odo1
3. odoD = odo2 - odo1   (odoDelta)
4. cpm = paid2 / odoD
5. create new collection and store: odo2, odoD paid2, cpm, date(?)
6. display in text: most recent charge cost per mile (in cent : cpm*100
7. 		    average cpm : avg of all cpms 
8.graph cpm data points  (cpm on y and odo on x)
9. add date of cpm ==> would prob be easiest if autmatically updated every time charge point gets added with a real $$$ amount, which now shoudl be every time
